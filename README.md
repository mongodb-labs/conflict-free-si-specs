```

### How To Run Scripts
The bash scripts repo contains an example script used to test for the presence of the write-skew anomaly in the serialization graph. Invariant definitions in TLA+ are used to specify events that one expects to see given the spec definition. In the case of the example mentioned above, write-skew is allowed under snapshot isolation and so the invariant definition will eventually fail when this case appears in the serialization graph.

```
WriteSkewAnomaly == 
    ~(
      /\ Cardinality(SerializationGraphWithEdgeTypes(txnHistory)) = 2
      /\ Cardinality(FindAllNodesInAnyCycle(SerializationGraph(txnHistory))) = 2
      /\ \E a,b \in FindAllNodesInAnyCycle(SerializationGraph(txnHistory)) :
        /\ Cardinality({a,b}) = 2
        /\ <<a, b, "RW">> \in SerializationGraphWithEdgeTypes(txnHistory)
        /\ <<b, a, "RW">> \in SerializationGraphWithEdgeTypes(txnHistory)
    )
```

In the code above, we first make sure that the Serialization graph has 2 nodes and 2 edges. This is a small cycle so it does not make a difference but in larger cycles, if this is not specified, you may end up with smaller subcycles in the larger cycle. Then we check for the 
existence of two nodes such that there is a RW edge from a to b and a RW egde from b to a. Since the expression inside the negation will return True if the write-skew example is found, we need to negate it as the anomaly only fails if the whole expression returns False.

In order to test this example, run the bash script as follows:
```
cd bash_scripts
chmod +x write-skew.sh
./write-skew.sh
```
This should generate the serialization graph in the `output/graphs/directory` and the causal order of operations in the `output/visualizations/directory`.

## ðŸ“‹ TLA+ Specification of Snapshot Isolation

This is a TLA+ specification that can be used for exploring and understanding snapshot isolation. I wrote it partly as a personal exercise and partly as an attempt to share the ideas and semantics of snapshot isolation with other engineers in a precise manner. My goal was to make this spec as simple as possible without removing necessary details. I wanted to focus more on high level concepts than on how a particular system might actually implement snapshot isolation. The comments explain in more detail the structure of the model and the various correctness properties. I drew some inspiration (and a few of the more tricky definitions) from Chris Newcombe's specification of snapshot isolation, which is a bit more complex than mine. He presented a few of his specs in a "Debugging Designs" talk at a [HPTS conference in 2011](http://hpts.ws/papers/2011/agenda.html). His two snapshot isolation specs are very thorough and well documented.

## Checking Properties with TLC

There a few properties already defined in the specification that you can try to verify yourself. Two concurrency anomalies that snapshot isolation allows, Write Skew and a ["read only" transaction anomaly](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/ROAnom.pdf) are included with examples, and there is a `ReadOnlyAnomaly` property that can be checked using TLC. The main invariant to check is that every history is serializable (which is expected to be violated by anomalous histories). To get started with a TLC model, you can use the following values for spec's `CONSTANT` parameters:

	Empty   <- Model value
	txnIds 	<- {t0, t1, t2}	    (Symmetry set of model values)
	keys 	<- {k1, k2}         (Symmetry set of model values)
	values 	<- {v1, v2}         (Symmetry set of model values)

You can choose `Spec` as the temporal formula and set either of the following two expressions as invariants to check:

*Assert that all histories are serializable:*

```tla
 IsSerializable(txnHistory)
 ```

*Assert that there are no non-serializable histories with a read-only transaction anomaly:*

```tla
 ~ReadOnlyAnomaly(txnHistory)
 ```

Both of these invariants should be violated in specific cases. By running the model checker you can see what kinds of histories violate these invariants.

## Model Checking Statistics

For reference, I was able to produce a trace that violated the `~ReadOnlyAnomaly(txnHistory)` invariant in 1 hour and 4 minutes running TLC on a 12-core (Intel i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz) Ubuntu Linux workstation. It generated a bit over 405 million distinct states and it took a 12 step trace to violate the invariant. While TLC was running it seemed to produce at least ~80GB of auxiliary data on disk, but I did not measure it precisely. You can see the detailed output of this run below:

Interestingly, running TLC in simulation mode (using the `-simulate` flag) produces a violating trace in just under 3 minutes, on the same hardware. This speedup may be due to the fact that, to produce this particular anomaly, a sufficiently long trace is required. Searching the state space in a breadth first manner (TLC's default) would require the checking of all possible "short" traces before testing out any longer ones. In fact, running TLC simulation in parallel, with 12 cores, often produced a violating trace in under a minute. It seems that simulation mode may be better at finding "interesting" traces more quickly than standard model checking model, at least for this particular model.
